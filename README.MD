## Features

- ark provides flexible configuration loading methods. It not only provides json/yaml local configuration file loaders by default, but also supports registration of remote configuration centers (such as apolloConfigClient).

- ark provides a powerful dynamic data source function. It supports all kinds of clients to access through the implementation of adapters, and can be redeployed in real time (second level) according to the configuration update.

- ark can be adapted to any web project built using nest.js.
